# Bash Scripting Fundamentals
## Introduction to Bash Scripting
Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is a command-line interpreter and scripting language primarily used on Unix-based operating systems. Bash scripting allows users to automate tasks, write complex scripts, and interact with the operating system via command-line interfaces. This document covers the fundamentals of Bash scripting, including variables, control structures, functions, and practical examples.

## Getting Started

### Setting Up Your Environment
Ensure you have a Unix-based operating system with Bash installed. Most Linux distributions come with Bash pre-installed. You can also use macOS, which also includes Bash by default.
